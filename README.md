# MeteoVache plugin for OpenCPN

meteovache_pi is a small weather plugin for OpenCPN. It provides weather forecasts anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection.
MeteoVache has been especially designed to be useable with very low bandwidth connections. It runs fine and fast with a low quality Edge GSM connection.
